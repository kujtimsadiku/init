# Ex: Thanks to the previous question and the reverse DNS find the name of your host
#
# A: So we write in termina "ipconfig getpacket en0"
# 	 getpacket we use to get all the information and we take the yiaddr
# 	 then we use command host <yiaddress=(stands for your IP address or Your Internet address)>
#	 
#	 I would use it like this:
#	 	whole command: host $(ipconfig getifaddr en0) | cut -d ' ' -f 5
