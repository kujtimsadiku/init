# Ex: Find the command that kills the background commandâ€™s process
#
# First i woould use jobs -l. You can use only jobs but it wont provide proccess id
# only [job id]
#
# with jobs -l we get the list same as with only jobs but we get the proccess id
# -9 kills all processse that we can kill
# So we use jobs -l then take the process id and then 
kill -9 <process id>
