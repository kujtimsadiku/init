# Ex: List all services which are started at boot time and name this kind of services
#
# I would use systemctl  
# i will add systemctl list-unit-files: this will list unit files installed on the system
# and it will tell us the state it has. What we are we looking is the state to be enabled.
#
# now we add
# --state=enabled
# systemctl list-unit-files --state=enabled
#
# but its not over. We also want the services only.
# so we add --type=service
#
# and just in case we put in the end -all to display all
sudo systemctl list-unit-files --state=enabled --type=service -all
