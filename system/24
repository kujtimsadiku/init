# Ex: Find the command that list all packages
#
# Im nnot sure do we want to check what we have installed or
# do we want to see all the packages that can be installed
# 
# this command shows all installed
# but sudo apt list = shows all the packages that can be installed
# But it might also crash the VM so i keep it simple and use "apt list --installed"
sudo apt list --installed
