# Ex: Figure out the exact size of each folder of /var in a humanly understandable way
#     followed by the path of it.
#
# we will use du which display the file space usage of certain file and path
# we use du annd we add the flags -h -s
# -h its same as in df "human-readable"
# -s summarize it= so it will display only a total for each argument
#
# and ofc we use sudo
# without the asteriks it will only show the var folder size.
# ofc its not a problem but the ex. wants the exact size of "each folder" in /var
sudo du -hs /var/*
