# Ex: Find the command that allows you to connect via ssh on the VM. (In parallel with
# the graphic session)
#
# you can enter with the basic syntax:
# ssh username@ip_address
# this command uses the default portal which is 22
#
# if the remote server is using non-standard port you will need to specify the connection
# ssh -p [PORTAL NUMBER] username@ip_address
# my answer in this case will be the first one
# just because i dont want to change any portals
#
# ps. if you think how to find easiest way the ip address
# just type hostname -I
ssh <USERNAME>@<IP_ADDRESS>
